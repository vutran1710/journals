# &lt;&lt; About Me &gt;&gt;

## Who am I?

That's a tough question but basically, I'm **Vu Tran**, a male, curious software developer based in [Hanoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoi), the capital of a country known as **Vietnam**, also an Earthling who is weak, no "useeee-The-Force" ability and live in the [Milky Way Galaxy](http://en.es-static.us/upl/2017/04/zodiacal-light-milky-way-Yuri-Beletsky.jpg) - technically god-knows-where in this universe.

## What I do?

I write songs that computers or web-browsers can sing along, though not all of them are catchy. They may be in JavaScript, Python, Clojure, Elixir... And 99% of the time, I write them with Emacs, since I'm a big fan.

In my free time, I'd love to read about computer & technology stuffs, things that help me learn and understand what I'm doing better. Also, I'd like to share knowledge with people and learn from them, so I write technical blogs about what I think interesting too.

A typical day of mine would be 70% ~ 90% about tech, regardless weekend of not. And the rest may go to beers, music and things.
